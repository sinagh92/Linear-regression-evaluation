# Linear-regression-evaluation

This project uses three methods for linear regression. The data files and the Python files should be in the same folder for the code to run.

Q1: Learning the linear regression model by solveing the normal equation.
Result: on the data with 100k samples and 300 features, this method takes  19.31 seconds and the final loss value is 12.50.

Q2: Learning the linear regression model by using the gradient descent algorithm.
Result: on the data with 10k samples and 100 features, this method takes  9.15 seconds and the final loss value is 259294.


Q3_1: Learning the linear regression model by using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm (on the smaller dataset with 10k samples and 100 features).
Result: on the data with 10k samples and 100 features, this method takes  3.17 seconds and the final loss value is 15.55.



Q3_2: Learning the linear regression model by using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm (on the larger dataset with 100k samples and 300 features).
Result: on the data with 100k samples and 300 features, this method takes  45.94 seconds and the final loss value is 63.78.
